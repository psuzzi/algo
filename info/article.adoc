Information about algorithms and data structures
== Preamble

Knowledge of algorithms and data structures is important for software engineers. To be good at solving problems you need practice. Here is some resource to make practie, and suggestion on the topic.

== Some problems

Here is some good problem to solve

Ex 01 - Rotate a 2D array without using extra space

https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotate-a-2d-array-without-using-extra-space/0

Here, the challenge is to rotate a 2D matrix without using extra space.


Exercise 02
